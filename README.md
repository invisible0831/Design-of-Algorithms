This repository contains all of my miniprojects of Design of Algorithms course at Sharif University of Technology
- Finding Convex hall and use it to find the maximum distance between any two points in a plane
- Sequence alignment using the BLOSUM62 score matrix to score pairs of aligned residues
- Buffered crossbar switch scheduling algorithms
- Finding node-independent paths in the graph between source and destination nodes
- Simplex algorithm for solving linear programming problems
